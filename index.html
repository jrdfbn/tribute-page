          Neck Deep are a Welsh pop punk band from Wrexham, Wales formed in
          2012. Founded after vocalist Ben Barlow met former lead guitarist
          Lloyd Roberts, the pair posted a song ("What Did You Expect?") online
          under the name Neck Deep. The song soon gained attention online,
          resulting in the addition of rhythm guitarist Matt West, drummer Dani
          Washington/Abasi, and bassist Fil Thorpe-Evans. They released a pair
          of EPs, Rain in July (2012) and A History of Bad Decisions (2013),
          both recorded by Barlow's older brother, before signing with Hopeless
          in August 2013.

          Following the release of their debut album Wishful Thinking in January
          2014, the band became a full-time project, with the band members
          leaving their jobs and/or dropping out of university courses. Shortly
          after the release of their second album Life's Not out to Get You in
          August 2015, Roberts left the band due to allegations of sexual
          misconduct (which he was subsequently found to have no case to
          answer[citation needed]),[1] and Sam Bowden (formerly of Climates and
          Blood Youth) joined in his place. The group's third album The Peace
          and the Panic was released August 2017, and debuted at #4 on the US
          Billboard 200. In September 2018, Thorpe-Evans left the band to pursue
          a solo career as a producer. In 2019, the band embarked in a summer
          tour with Blink-182 as the opening act. By February 2020, the band
          added longtime collaborator and bassist Seb Barlow as an official
          member, plus later that month revealed an app with all sorts of
          multimedia regarding the announcement of their fourth album, titled
          All Distortions Are Intentional, released 24 July.
